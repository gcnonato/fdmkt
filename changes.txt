There is a part on merchant settings that you guys added, which is not part of requirement.
This:
Captura de pantalla 2017-04-18 a la(s) 00.28.53.png
People don't need to type anything
Please delete that blank space from /store/merchantsignupinfo as well.
so should we remove that textarea?
When food_handling_card = "En proceso", then  merchant_food_message = "En proceso"
And
When food_handling_card = "No cuento con permiso", then  merchant_food_message = "No cuento con permiso"
There is no need for people to Type, it is only required to select an image when: food_handling_card = "Al día",

I checked, and we are almost there. Just make sure to display information on any of the 3 statuses.For example: Show data wether "En proceso" or "No cuento con permiso" is selectedIn this example, merchant selected "En proceso", so system must show it:

Hello, let me handle you QA observations: Instead of select, it should say: "Selecciona una opción"
Instead of "Cuenta con permiso de manipulación de alimentos:", it must say "Permiso de manipulación de alimentos:"
